In this project i built a front-end Netflix clone called danflix with firebase backend. I used the TMDB(themoviedb) API for all the 
data AND i will be using Firebase Authentication to give the login functionality. I'll be storing data with a React front-end and firebase back-end. I use Firestore which is a cloud storage in firebase to save data. All the styling is
done with the Tailwind CSS to save time. After everything, i deploy the project with Firebase hosting.

one gotcha to note is that firebase won't allow you delete anything on the server side, so you handle it on the client side. 
So we use the filter: it takes your array remove what you don't want
