In this project i built a front-end Netflix clone called danflix with firebase backend. I used the TMDB API for all the 
data AND i will be using Firebase Authentication to give the login functionality. I'll be storing data with a React front-end and firebase back-end. I use Firestore which is a cloud storage in firebase to save data. All the styling is
done with the Tailwind CSS to save time. After everything, i deploy the project with Firebase hosting.
